The Web Scheduler is a highly-available, distributed, task-scheduling system allowing users to schedule tasks, one time, or recurring, that will use a variety of delivery mechanisms to send a signal and trigger something in a remote application.

See the blog post series here: [Building a Distributed Task Scheduler on DigitalOcean's App Platform](https://throw.nullreference.io/series/building-a-distributed-task-scheduler-on-digitalocean-app-platform/).
